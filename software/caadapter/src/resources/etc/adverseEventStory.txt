Clinical AdverseEvent Scenario


The places and names are completely made up by picking first names separate last names and streets from a phone book and magazine.

We'll be testing a new biologic drug which is an anti colon cancer monoclonal antibody. It is given IV to treat advanced colon cancer. These kind of drugs often end their names with "umab" so we'll call it Lumaxumab. (no reason at all for this name)

Sometimes biologic drugs cause autoimmune diseases. So we'll pick a relatively rare one.
Polymyositis associated with interstitial lung disease and anti-Jo1 antibodies.

So we'll start with a patient

Ruth Simmons age 67 Female with colon cancer metastatic to liver. She was diagnosed 3 years ago and has failed conventional chemo therapy.
Her address is 1625 Mission Blvd, Fremont, CA 94538

She is treated by
Dr Deborah Wolfe of 3945 Decoto Road Fremont, CA 94538
Who is an oncologist at Lincoln Medical Center

I don't know how much of the clinical scenario needs to be written to get enough data to put in our sample message. So some of this may be unnecessary.

Lets say she received 4 infusions of 1200mg each. Lets say they were 2 months apart and were given on October 20th 2003 Dec 22 2003 Feb 23 2004 and April 26 2004

She starts complaining of shortness of breath and coughing on April 30th. She see's her doctor and a history and physical reveals muscle weakness diffusely. Blood tests are done which reveal high muscle enzymes
CPK 12,224 ESR 124 and positive ANA titer >320. A test the next week shows the presence of anti Jo1 antibody. A chest Xray shows diffuse interstitial disease.

A diagnosis of polymyositis with interstitial lung disease is made. Since this is an unusual disease and occurred during the clinical trial of the new anti cancer biologic drug Lumaxumab, an adverse event must be reported.
