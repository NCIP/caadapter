2.16.840.1.113883.11.10196,ActMood,
A code distinguishing whether an Act is conceived of as a factual statement or in some other manner as a command, possibility, goal, etc.

Constraints: An Act-instance must have one and only one moodCode value.

The moodCode of a single Act-instance never changes. Mood is not state.

To describe the progression of a business activity from defined to planned to executed, etc. one must instantiate different Act-instances in the different moods and link them using ActRelationship of general type "sequel". (See ActRelationship.type.)

, Based on ActMood,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10197,ActMoodCompletionTrack,These are moods describing activities as they progress in the business cycle, from defined, through planned and ordered to completed., Based on ActMood,,

, Based on Confidentiality,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10229,ConfidentialityByAccessKind,By accessing subject / role and relationship based rights (These concepts are mutually exclusive, one and only one is required for a valid confidentiality coding.), Based on Confidentiality,,

2.16.840.1.113883.11.10240,ConfidentialityByInfoType,By information type, only for service catalog entries (multiples allowed). Not to be used with actual patient data!, Based on Confidentiality,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10247,ParticipationAncillary,Participations related, but not primary to an act. The Referring, Admitting, and Discharging practitioners must be the same person as those authoring the ControlAct event for their respective trigger events., Based on ParticipationType,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10248,ParticipationPhysicalPerformer,A person who actually and principally carries out the action. Need not be the principal responsible actor, e.g. a surgery resident operating under supervision of attending surgeon, and may be the patient in self-care, e.g. fingerstick blood sugar. The traditional order filler is a performer. This information should accompany every service event., Based on ParticipationType,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10251,ParticipationInformationGenerator,Parties that may or should contribute or have contributed information to the Act. Such information includes information leading to the decision to perform the Act and how to perform the Act (e.g., consultant), information that the Act itself seeks to reveal (e.g., informant of clinical history), or information about what Act was performed (e.g., informant witness)., Based on ParticipationType,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10259,ParticipationVerifier,A person who verifies the correctness and appropriateness of the service (plan, order, event, etc.) and hence takes on accountability., Based on ParticipationType,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10263,ParticipationInformationRecipient,A party, who may or should receive or who has recieved the Act or subsequent or derivative information of that Act. Information recipient is inert, i.e., independent of mood." Rationale: this is a generalization of a too diverse family that the definition can't be any more specific, and the concept is abstract so one of the specializations should be used., Based on ParticipationType,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10267,ParticipationFunction,This code is used to specify the exact function an actor had in a service in all necessary detail. This domain may include local extensions (CWE)., Based on ParticipationFunction,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10282,ParticipationSignature,
A code specifying whether and how the participant has attested his participation through a signature and or whether such a signature is needed.

Examples: A surgical Procedure act object (representing a procedure report) requires a signature of the performing and responsible surgeon, and possibly other participants. (See also: Participation.signatureText.)

, Based on ParticipationSignature,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10286,ParticipationTargetDirect,Target that is substantially present in the service and which is directly affected by the service action (includes consumed material, devices, etc.)., Based on ParticipationType,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10298,ParticipationTargetDevice,Something used in delivering the service without being substantially affected by the service (i.e. durable or inert with respect to that particular service.) Examples are: monitoring equipment, tools, but also access/drainage lines, prostheses, pace maker, etc., Based on ParticipationType,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.103,ProcessingID,This attribute defines whether the message is part of a production, training, or debugging system. , Based on ProcessingID,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10302,ParticipationTargetLocation,The facility where the service is done. May be a static building (or room therein) or a moving location (e.g., ambulance, helicopter, aircraft, train, truck, ship, etc.), Based on ParticipationType,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10310,TargetAwareness,
A code specifying the extent to which the Entity playing the participating Role (usually as a target Participation) is aware of the associated Act.

Examples: For diagnostic observations, is the patient, family member or other participant aware of his terminal illness?

Discussion: If the awareness, denial, unconsciousness, etc. is the subject of medical considerations (e.g., part of the problem list), one should use explicit observations in these matters as well, and should not solely rely on this simple attribute in the Participation.

, Based on TargetAwareness,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10317,ActRelationshipType,
A code specifying the meaning and purpose of every ActRelationship instance. Each of its values implies specific constraints to what kinds of Act objects can be related and in which way.

Discussion: The types of act relationships fall under one of 5 categories:

1.) (De)-composition, with composite (source) and component (target)

2.) Sequel which includes follow-up, fulfillment, instantiation, replacement, transformation, etc. that all have in common that source and target are Acts of essentially the same kind but with variances in mood and other attributes, and where the target exists before the source and the source refers to the target that it links back to.

3.) Pre-condition, trigger, reason, contraindication, with the conditioned Act at the source and the condition or reason at the target.

4.) Post-condition, outcome, goal and risk, with the Act at the source having the outcome or goal at the target.

5.) A host of functional relationships including support, cause, derivation, etc. generalized under the notion of "pertinence".

, Based on ActRelationshipType,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10318,ActRelationshipHasComponent,A collection of sub-services as steps or subtasks performed for the source service. Services may be performed sequentially or concurrently., Based on ActRelationshipType,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10324,ActRelationshipOutcome,An observation that should follow or does actually follow as a result or consequence of a condition or action (sometimes called ?ost-condition?) Target must be an observation as a goal, risk or any criterion. For complex outcomes a conjunction attribute, Based on ActRelationshipType,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10329,ActRelationshipPertains,This is a very unspecific relationship from one item of clinical information to another. It does not judge about the role the pertinent information plays., Based on ActRelationshipType,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10330,ActClassHasSupport,Used to indicate that an existing service is suggesting evidence for a new observation. The assumption of support is attributed to the same actor who asserts the observation. Source must be an observation, target may be any service (e.g., to indicate a status post.), Based on ActRelationshipType,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10337,ActRelationshipSequel,An act relationship indicating that the source act follows the target act. The source act should in principle represent the same kind of act as the target. Source and target need not have the same mood code (mood will often differ). The target of a sequel is called antecedent. Examples for sequel relationships are: revision, transformation, derivation from a prototype (as a specialization is a derivation of a generalization), followup, realization, instantiation., Based on ActRelationshipType,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10338,ActRelationshipReplacement,A replacement source act replaces an existing target act. The state of the target act being replaced becomes obselete, but the act is typically still retained in the system for historical reference. The source and target must be of the same type., Based on ActRelationshipType,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10342,ActRelationshipFulfills,The source act fulfills (in whole or in part) the target act. Source act must be in a mood equal or more actual than the target act., Based on ActRelationshipType,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10349,ActRelationshipCheckpoint,
A code specifying when in the course of an Act a precondition for the Act is evaluated (e.g., before the Act starts for the first time, before every repetition, after each repetition but not before the first, or throughout the entire time of the Act.)

Discussion: This attribute is part of the workflow control suite of attributes. An action plan is a composite Act with component Acts. In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Before each step is executed and has preconditions these conditions are tested and if the test is positive, the Act has clearance for execution. The repeatNumber may indicate that an Act may be repeatedly executed. The checkpointCode is specifies when the precondition is checked and is analogous to the various conditional statements and loop constructs in programming languages "while-do" vs. "do-while" or "repeat-until" vs. "loop-exit".

For all checkpointCodes, except "end", preconditions are being checked at the time when the preceding step of the plan has terminated and this step would be next in the sequence established by the sequenceNumber attribute. 

When the checkpointCode for a criterion of a repeatable Act is "end", the criterion is tested only at the end of each repetition of that Act. When the condition holds true, the next repetition is ready for execution. 

When the checkpointCode is "entry" the criterion is checked at the beginning of each repetition (if any) whereas "beginning" means the criterion is checked only once before the repetition "loop" starts.

The checkpointCode "through" is special in that it requires the condition to hold throughout the execution of the Act, even throughout a single execution. As soon as the condition turns false, the Act should receive an interrupt event (see interruptibleInd) and will eventually terminate.

The checkpointCode "exit" is only used on a special plan step that represents a loop exit step. This allows an action plan to exit due to a condition tested inside the execution of this plan. Such exit criteria are sequenced with the other plan components using the ActRelationship.sequenceNumber.

, Based on ActRelationshipCheckpoint,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10355,ActRelationshipSplit,
A code specifying how branches in an action plan are selected among other branches.

Discussion: This attribute is part of the workflow control suite of attributes. An action plan is a composite Act with component Acts. In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Branches exist when multiple components have the same sequenceNumber. The splitCode specifies whether a branch is executed exclusively (case-switch) or inclusively, i.e., in parallel with other branches. 

In addition to exlusive and inclusive split the splitCode specifies how the pre-condition (also known as "guard conditions" on the branch) are evaluated. A guard condition may be evaluated once when the branching step is entered and if the conditions do not hold at that time, the branch is abandoned. Conversely execution of a branch may wait until the guard condition turns true.

In exclusive wait branches, the first branch whose guard conditions turn true will be executed and all other branches abandoned. In inclusive wait branches some branches may already be executed while other branches still wait for their guard conditions to turn true.

, Based on ActRelationshipSplit,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10360,ActRelationshipJoin,
A code specifying how concurrent Acts are resynchronized in a parallel branch construct.

Discussion: This attribute is part of the workflow control suite of attributes. An action plan is a composite Act with component Acts. In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Branches exist when multiple components have the same sequenceNumber. Branches are parallel if the splitCode specifies that more than one branch can be executed at the same time. The joinCode then specifies if and how the braches are resynchronized.

The principal re-synchronization actions are (1) the control flow waits for a branch to terminate (wait-branch), (2) the branch that is not yet terminated is aborted (kill-branch), (3) the branch is not re-synchronized at all and continues in parallel (detached branch).

A kill branch is only executed if there is at least one active wait (or exclusive wait) branch. If there is no other wait branch active, a kill branch is not started at all (rather than being aborted shortly after it is started.) Since a detached branch is unrelated to all other branches, active detached branches do not protect a kill-branch from being aborted.

, Based on ActRelationshipJoin,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10365,RelationshipConjunction,
A code specifying the logical conjunction of the criteria among all the condition-links of Acts (e.g., and, or, exclusive-or.)

Constraints: All AND criteria must be true. If OR and AND criteria occur together, one criterion out of the OR-group must be true and all AND criteria must be true also. If XOR criteria occur together with OR and AND criteria, exactly one of the XOR criteria must be true, and at least one of the OR criteria and all AND criteria must be true. In other words, the sets of AND, OR, and XOR criteria are in turn combined by a logical AND operator (all AND criteria and at least one OR criterion and exactly one XOR criterion.) To overcome this ordering, Act criteria can be nested in any way necessary.

2.16.840.1.113883.11.10429,RoleClassPartitive,An association between two Entities where the playing Entity is considered in some way "part" of the scoping Entity, e.g., as a member, component, ingredient, or content. Being "part" in the broadest sense of the word can mean anything from being an integral structural component to a mere incidental temporary association of a playing Entity with a (generally larger) scoping Entity., Based on RoleClass,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.10430,RoleClassIngredientEntity,Relates a component (player) to a mixture (scoper). E.g., Glucose and Water are ingredients of D5W, latex may be an ingredient in a tracheal tube., Based on RoleClass,,

In addition, clinical documents commonly contain 'Assessments', which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation., Based on ActClass,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.11530,ActClassPublicHealthCase,A public health case is an Observation representing a condition or event that has a specific significance for public health.

2.16.840.1.113883.11.11555,RoleClass,
This table includes codes for the Role class hierarchy. The values in this hierarchy, represent a Role which is an association or relationship between two entities - the entity that plays the role and the entity that scopes the role. Roles names are derived from the name of the playing entity in that role.

The role hierarchy stems from three core concepts, or abstract domains:

RoleClassOntological is an abstract domain that collects roles in which the playing entity is defined or specified by the scoping entity.

RoleClassPartitive collects roles in which the playing entity is in some sense a "part" of the scoping entity.

RoleClassAssociative collects all of the remaining forms of association between the playing entity and the scoping entity. This set of roles is further partitioned between:

RoleClassPassive which are roles in which the playing entity is used, known, treated, handled, built, or destroyed, etc. under the auspices of the scoping entity. The playing entity is passive in these roles in that the role exists without an agreement from the playing entity.

RoleClassMutualRelationship which are relationships based on mutual behavior of the two entities. The basis of these relationship may be formal agreements or they may be de facto behavior. Thus, this sub-domain is further divided into:

RoleClassRelationshipFormal in which the relationship is formally defined, frequently by a contract or agreement.

Personal relationship which inks two people in a personal relationship. 

The hierarchy discussed above is represented In the current vocabulary tables as a set of abstract domains, with the exception of the "Personal relationship" which is a leaf concept.

2.16.840.1.113883.11.13856,ActClassRoot,An action of interest that has happened, can happen, is happening, is intended to happen, or is requested/demanded to happen. An act is an intentional action in the business domain of HL7. Healthcare (and any profession or business) is constituted of intentional actions. An Act instance is a record of such an intentional action. Any intentional action can exist in different ""moods"". Moods describe activities as they progress in the business cycle, from defined, through planned and ordered to complete. Any instance of an Act assumes one and only one mood and will not change its mood along its life cycle. The moods - definition, intent, order, event - seem to specify a life cycle of an activity. However, the participants in the activity in these different moods are different, as is the data. Therefore, the mood of an Act instance is static. The progression actualization (i.e., the progression from defined, through planned and ordered, to being performed) is called the ""business cycle"" to distinguish it from the ""life cycle"" of a single act instance. Related Act instances that form such a ""business cycle"" are linked through the ActRelationship class. Examples for acts in health care are: a clinical test, an assessment of health condition (such as problems and diagnoses), the setting of healthcare goals, the performance of treatment services (such as medication, surgery, physical and psychological therapy), assisting, monitoring or attending, training and education services to patients and their next of kin, and notary services (such as advanced directives or living will). Acts have participants, which can be actors or targets. Examples of actors are nurses, doctors, family members, notary publics, and service organizations -- every person or organization that is capable of independent decisions and can thus is responsible (and liable) for the actions performed. Target participants in an act may include the patient, the patient's spouse, family, or community, a specimen drawn from the patient or from any object of interest. As patients do play active roles in their own healthcare, the patient can be both an active participant and a target participant at the same time (self-administered or reflexive services). An act can have multiple active participants and multiple target participants, their specific role being distinguished in the ""typeCode"" of the respective instance of the Participation class. In particular, an act involving coordination of care may involve two or more active participants -- playing different roles -- who interact on behalf of a patient, family, or aggregate in the role of target participant. For example, a nurse (active participant) calls Meals on Wheels (active participant) on behalf of the patient (target participant). An act includes the ""results"", ""answers"" or informational ""procedure products"" gained during the act. In this model, ""results"" do not exist without an act, and every clinical result, including those results gained accidentally, is gleaned via an act. In other moods, such as ""definition "" or ""intent"", the results are the possible results, the expected or aimed-for results, or the tested-for results., Based on ActClass,,

2.16.840.1.113883.11.13948,ActClassClinicalDocument,A clinical document is a documentation of clinical observations and services, with the following characteristics: (1) Persistence - A clinical document continues to exist in an unaltered state, for a time period defined by local and regulatory requirements; (2) Stewardship - A clinical document is maintained by a person or organization entrusted with its care; (3) Potential for authentication - A clinical document is an assemblage of information that is intended to be legally authenticated; (4)?holeness - Authentication of a clinical document applies to the whole and does not apply to portions of the document without the full context of the document; (5) Human readability - A clinical document is human readable.", Based on ActClass,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.13953,ActCode,
A code specifying the particular kind of Act that the Act-instance represents within its class.

Constraints: The kind of Act (e.g. physical examination, serum potassium, inpatient encounter, charge financial transaction, etc.) is specified with a code from one of several, typically external, coding systems. The coding system will depend on the class of Act, such as LOINC for observations, etc.

Conceptually, the Act.code must be a specialization of the Act.classCode. This is why the structure of ActClass domain should be reflected in the superstructure of the ActCode domain and then individual codes or externally referenced vocabularies subordinated under these domains that reflect the ActClass structure.

Act.classCode and Act.code are not modifiers of each other but the Act.code concept should really imply the Act.classCode concept. For a negative example, it is not appropriate to use an Act.code "potassium" together with and Act.classCode for "laboratory observation" to somehow mean "potassium laboratory observation" and then use the same Act.code for "potassium" together with Act.classCode for "medication" to mean "substitution of potassium". This mutually modifying use of Act.code and Act.classCode is not permitted.

2.16.840.1.113883.11.14878,ActReason,
A code specifying the motivation, cause, or rationale of an Act, when such rationale is not reasonably representable as an ActRelationship of type "has reason" linking to another Act.

Examples: Example reasons that might qualify for being coded in this field might be: "routine requirement", "infectious disease reporting requirement", "on patient request", "required by law".

Discussion 

Most reasons for acts can be clearly expressed by linking the new Act to another prior Act using an ActRelationship of type "has reason". This simply states that the prior Act is a reason for the new Act (see ActRelationship.) The prior act can then be a specific existing act or a textual explanation. This works for most cases, and the more specific the reason data is, the more should this reason ActRelationship be used instead of the reasonCode. 

The reasonCode remains as a place for common reasons that are not related to a prior Act or any other condition expressed in Acts. Indicators that something was required by law or was on the request of a patient etc. may qualify. However, if that piece of legislation, regulation, or the contract or the patient request can be represented as an Act (and they usually can), the reasonCode should not be used.

2.16.840.1.113883.11.14914,Race,In the United States, federal standards for classifying data on race determine the categories used by federal agencies and exert a strong influence on categorization by state and local agencies and private sector organizations. The federal standards do not conceptually define race, and they recognize the absence of an anthropological or scientific basis for racial classification. Instead, the federal standards acknowledge that race is a social-political construct in which an individual's own identification with one more race categories is preferred to observer identification. The standards use a variety of features to define five minimum race categories. Among these features are descent from "the original peoples" of a specified region or nation. The minimum race categories are American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White. The federal standards stipulate that race data need not be limited to the five minimum categories, but any expansion must be collapsible to those categories., Based on Race,,

2.16.840.1.113883.11.16857,ActControlVariable,An observation form that determines parameters or attributes of an Act. Examples are the settings of a ventilator machine as parameters of a ventilator treatment act; the controls on dillution factors of a chemical analyzer as a parameter of a laboratory observation act; the settings of a physiologic measurement assembly (e.g., time skew) or the position of the body while measuring blood pressure. Control variables are forms of observations because just as with clinical observations, the Observation.code determines the parameter and the Observation.value assigns the value. While control variables sometimes can be observed (by noting the control settings or an actually measured feedback loop) they are not primary observations, in the sense that a control variable without a primary act is of no use (e.g., it makes no sense to record a blood pressure position without recording a blood pressure, whereas it does make sense to record a systolic blood pressure without a diastolic blood pressure)., Based on ActCode,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.16866,ActPriority,A code or set of codes (e.g., for routine, emergency,) specifying the urgency under which the Act happened, can happen, is happening, is intended to happen, or is requested/demanded to happen. 

Discussion: This attribute is used in orders to indicate the ordered priority, and in event documentation it indicates the actual priority used to perform the act. In definition mood it indicates the available priorities.

, Based on ActPriority,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.16871,ActPriorityCallback,Filler should contact the placer (or target) to schedule the service. (Was ??in HL7 version 2.3's TQ-priority component.), Based on ActPriority,, 
2.16.840.1.113883.11.16899,ActUncertainty,
A code indicating whether the Act statement as a whole, with its subordinate components has been asserted to be uncertain in any way. 

Examples: Patient might have had a cholecystectomy procedure in the past (but isn't sure).

Constraints: Uncertainty asserted using this attribute applies to the combined meaning of the Act statement established by all descriptive attributes (e.g., Act.code, Act.effectiveTime, Observation.value, SubstanceAdministration.doseQuantity, etc.), and the meanings of any components.

Discussion: This is not intended for use to replace or compete with uncertainty associated with a Observation.values alone or other individual attributes of the class. Such pointed indications of uncertainty should be specified by applying the PPD, UVP or UVN data type extensions to the specific attribute. Particularly if the uncertainty is uncertainty of a quantitative measurement value, this must still be represented by a PPD in the value and NOT using the uncertaintyCode. Also, when differential diagnoses are enumerated or weighed for probability, the UVP or UVN must be used, not the uncertaintyCode. The use of the uncertaintyCode is appropriate only if the entirety of the Act and its dependent Acts is questioned.

2.16.840.1.113883.11.19465,NUCCProviderCodes,In the absence of an all-encompassing Provider Classification System, both X12N and the National Provider System Workgroup from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) commenced work on identifying and coding an external provider table that would be able to codify provider type and provider area of specialization for all medical related providers. CMS' intent was to provide a single coding structure to support work on the National Provider System, while X12N needed a single common table for trading partner use. The two projects worked independently to some extent until April 1996 when the lists were coordinated and a single taxonomy was proposed. A sub-group of the X12N TG2 WG 15 was charged with resolving differences in the two proposed taxonomies. Their work resulted in a single taxonomy that both CMS and members of X12N found meaningful, easy to use, and functional for electronic transactions. The sub-group initially started with the CMS draft taxonomy. This list incorporated all types of providers associated with medical care in various ways. Many of the providers listed, such as technologists or technicians, support or repair equipment/machinery. A number of the providers offer medical services, in concert with others, and do not or cannot bill independently for their portion. The amount of research to validate and classify all providers using the proposed hierarchical structure was enormous. The X12N sub-group focused on medical providers who are licensed practitioners, those who bill for health-related services rendered, and those who appeared on the Medicare CMS Provider Specialty listing. This included providers who were licensed to practice medicine via state licensure agencies. In addition, a very broad definition of "areas of specialization" was used, which included nationally recognized specialties, provider self-designated specialties, areas of practice focus, and any request by any agency or trading partner submitted before the first taxonomy release. This level of detail captured specialty information in categories detailed enough to support those trading credentialing information, yet broad enough to support those wishing to trade directory level specialization information. In 2001, ANSI ASC X12N asked the NUCC to become the official maintainer of the Health Care Provider Taxonomy List. The NUCC has a formal operating protocol and its membership includes representation from key provider and payer organizations, as well as state and federal agencies, standard development organizations and the National Uniform Billing Committee (NUBC). Criteria for membership includes a national scope and representation of a unique constituency affected by health care electronic commerce, with an emphasis on maintaining a provider/payer balance., Based on NUCC Provider Codes,,

2.16.840.1.113883.11.78,ObservationInterpretation,
One or more codes specifying a rough qualitative interpretation of the observation, such as "normal", "abnormal", "below normal", "change up", "resistant", "susceptible", etc.

Discussion: These interpretation codes are sometimes called "abnormal flags", however, the judgment of normalcy is just one of the common rough interpretations, and is often not relevant. For example, the susceptibility interpretations are not about "normalcy", and for any observation of a pathologic condition, it does not make sense to state the normalcy, since pathologic conditions are never considered "normal."

2.16.840.1.113883.6.163,MDR,MedDRA is a five-level hierarchy of terms. MedDRA was developed as an ICH initiative and is maintained and distributed by the MedDRA Maintenance and Support Services Organization (MSSO). Versions  Versions are released twice per year and are identified by 2 numbers separated by a decimal point (e.g., 7.0, 7.1, 8.0, and 8.1). .0 releases may contain changes to the hierarchy. .1 releases will only contain additions, moves, and modifications of medical concept terms (Preferred Terms) and coding level terms (Lowest Level Terms). Concepts  Concepts are represented by a MedDRA code and a MedDRA term name. The MedDRA code is an eight digit numeric code. MedDRA codes are unique and are never reused. The MedDRA term name is a 100 character alphanumeric field used to describe the concept or term. Hierarchies  MedDRA is structured as a five level hierarchy. System Organ Classes (SOCs) are the broadest terms (e.g., Cardiac disorders, Investigations). The lowest level of the terminology is the Lowest Level Term (LLT) level. There are 26 SOCs and over 60,000 LLTs ,,

2.16.840.1.113883.6.18,IB,ISBT 128 is a coding system for blood components, hematopoietic progenitor cells and other tissues. It is comprised of an overall Application Specification, and labeling and coding documents for the separate sections: blood components, hematopoietic progenitor cells (draft), source plasma (draft) and tissues (draft). The documentation is supported by databases: Country/Collection Facility, Product Code (blood components), Product Code (hematopoietic progenitor sells), Product Code (source plasma), Product Code (tissues) and Special Testing. ISBT 128 is designed as a series of data structures that are designed to be technology-independent and can be used for bar coding, radio frequency tag encoding and electronic data interchange. The HL7 Blood Bank SIG is currently designing example messages that incorporate ISBT 128 coding. No changes of any kind will be needed to use ISBT 128 in HL7 messages.,,

2.16.840.1.113883.6.20,NDA,The terminology consists of standardized terms and codes for patient problems or life processes expressed as nursing diagnoses. These data elements would be classified by HL7 as ?bservations? The taxonomy is multi-axial. It consists of 12 domains and 36 classes. All domains and classes are defined. There are 7 axes with definitions for each. Each nursing diagnosis consists of: a concept label or term expressed as a noun or a noun phrase; a definition of the term; a set of defining characteristics (signs and symptoms) of the diagnostic term; an approved list of modifiers of the term; a set of risk factors with definitions; and a set of related factors (or etiologies) for the term. The system preserves semantics by having robust review procedures and policies to ensure against semantic drift in the meanings of the encoded terms over time. NANDA as an organization is committed to updating the terminology on a regular biannual basis. NANDA has been in existence since 1973 and is thus the oldest developer of standardized language in nursing. Most other nursing language systems use many of the older NANDA terms in their vocabularies. The express purpose of the organization is to develop a comprehensive standardized nursing language that captures the conclusions that nurses make based on observations ?in effect, the nursing diagnoses. The work is a continuing effort and diagnoses are revised, retired or added bi-annually. The codes are simple integers and are not linked to each other. If a diagnostic term is retired, the code is also retired. If a new diagnosis is added a new code is given to that term. If a diagnostic term is revised, the code is kept intact but the date of the revision is published alongside the term. Domains and classes are not coded.,,

2.16.840.1.113883.6.88,RxNorm,RxNorm provides standard names for clinical drugs (active ingredient + strength + dose form) and for dose forms as administered to a patient. It provides links from clinical drugs, both branded and generic, to their active ingredients, drug components (active ingredient + strength), and related brand names. NDCs (National Drug Codes) for specific drug products (where there are often many NDC codes for a single product) are linked to that product in RxNorm. RxNorm links its names to many of the drug vocabularies commonly used in pharmacy management and drug interaction software, including those of First Databank, Micromedex, MediSpan, and Multum. By providing links between these vocabularies, RxNorm can mediate messages between systems not using the same software and vocabulary. RxNorm is one of a suite of designated standards for use in U.S. Federal Government systems for the electronic exchange of clinical health information. ,,

2.16.840.1.113883.6.96,SNOMED-CT,SNOMED CT is a concept-based, scientifically validated terminology that provides a unique and permanent concept identifier that can be included in multiple HL7 data types including CD and CE. The concepts are managed to avoid "semantic drift" so the meaning remains constant. If the concept is found to be ambiguous or the meaning changes, the concept is inactivated but still retained and the identifier is never reused. SNOMED CT's concepts are interrelated hierarchically and using description logic. SNOMED CT concepts have a unique "fully-specified name," a preferred term, and, optionally, synonyms. The descriptions include English, Spanish, and German. ,,
