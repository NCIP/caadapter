HL7	TQ Conjunction ID	0472	A	Asynchronous: Do the next specification in parallel with this one (unless otherwise constrained by the following components: ORC-7^4-start date/time and ORC-7^5-end date/time).  The conjunction of "A" specifies two parallel instructions, as are somet
HL7	TQ Conjunction ID	0472	C	This is an actuation time.  It will be followed by a completion time for the service.  This code allows one to distinguish between the time and priority at which a service should be actuated (e.g., blood should be drawn) and the time and priority at
HL7	TQ Conjunction ID	0472	S	Synchronous. Do the next specification after this one (unless otherwise constrained by the following components: ORC-7^4-start date/time and ORC-7^5-end date/time). An "S" specification implies that the second timing sequence follows the first, e.g.,
